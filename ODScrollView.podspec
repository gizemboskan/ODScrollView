# This description is used to generate tags and improve search results.
#   * Think: What does it do? Why did you write it? What is the focus?
#   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.
#   * Write the description between the DESC delimiters below.
#   * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!

In these cases, we often encounter the overlap of the this UIViews with the keyboard. ODScrollView is a UIScrollView that automatically detects this UIViews and moves them according to the given settings. Besides that it has lots of other features and is developer friendly!'
